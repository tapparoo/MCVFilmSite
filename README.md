## MVC Film Query Site
This Week 7 [Skill Distillery](http://skilldistillery.com) weekend group project
is a continuation of [week 6's individual project](https://github.com/tapparoo/FilmQueryProject).

The project can now be exported to a .war file and is runnable on a server
running Apache Tomcat 8.5

Users utilize the app's GUI to search through a pre-existing sample database that
contains 1000 films.  Searches are made by ID or keyword and users will be shown
details of the selected movie.

Users can now also:
- Add a new film to the database
- Delete a new film from the database
- Save changes to any film
